#Nested tests
##Overview
nested tests is used when you have a main scenario and a set of alternative scenarios,
in this case you can have your alternative scenario as nested test.
For example you can have a title tests and a nested tests for title not plank. In this case, both your tesst and nested 
test are using the same initial state.
Nested tests allow us to group tests as parent and children.
